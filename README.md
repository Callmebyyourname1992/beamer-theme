:bar_chart: My sensible LaTeX beamer template for presentations

Inspired by [this post](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/158657) where by I
wanted a Beamer template that didn't overwhelmingly scream, "I made this with
LaTeX and Beamer."

See [Beamer User Guide][beamerguide] (Chapter 5 Guidelines for Creating
Presentations) for sensible advice on making presentations.

Some notable points:

1. Think of creating a global structure to presentation depending on length
2. If using a table of contents, make it comprehensible before the talk
3. "Do not inflict pain on other people"
